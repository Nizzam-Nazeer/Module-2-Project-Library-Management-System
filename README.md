In the Library Management System, the database is structured into six tables: Branch, Employee, Books, Customer, IssueStatus, and ReturnStatus. The Branch table contains details about library branches including their unique Branch_no, manager ID, address, and contact number. The Employee table includes employee details such as ID, name, position, salary, and a foreign key referencing the branch they belong to. The Books table tracks each book's ISBN, title, category, rental price, availability status, author, and publisher. The Customer table records customer information including ID, name, address, and registration date. The IssueStatus and ReturnStatus tables track the issuance and return of books, respectively, linking customers and books through foreign keys.

To interact with this database, several SQL queries can be used to retrieve useful information. For example, you can retrieve the titles, categories, and rental prices of available books, and list employees by descending salary. You can also identify which customers have issued books and get a count of books in each category. Additionally, it is possible to find employees with salaries above Rs. 50,000, list customers who registered before a specific date and havenâ€™t issued books, and get branch details including employee counts. Other queries can show customers who issued books with rental prices over Rs. 25 and find branches with more than 5 employees, as well as employees who manage branches and their addresses.
